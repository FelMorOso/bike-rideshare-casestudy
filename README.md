### Case Study Quick Summary
Cyclistic is a bike ridesharing company with two types of customers: casual customers and annual members. Annual members are more profitable and have bought a subscription to the service for the year. Casual customers buy passes on a shorter term basis that can include single rides or weekly passes. Cyclistic is interested in converting casual customers into annual members. The aim of this project is to understand the difference in usage of the service between casual customers and annual members to better target casual riders with marketing.

### Case Study Recommendations Summary
The recommendations, based on my data analysis, for this case study are as follows:

1. Target marketing more heavily for casual members during the summer months (June through August). 
2. Target marketing more heavily for casual members during the weekends (Saturday and Sunday). 
3. Emphasize the increased recreational opportunities available to annual members during marketing. This means showcasing how one can take more long rides during the summer when buying an annual membership.

## Case Study Documentation
My data analysis and graphs were created in RStudio using R. I document this process in a .Rmd file [here](./Cyclistic%20Case%20Study.Rmd) but it can be viewed [here](./Cyclistic-Case-Study.md) as a Markdown file.
